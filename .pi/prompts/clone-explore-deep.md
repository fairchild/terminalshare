description: Clone a repo into ~/code/github/<owner>/<repo>, inspect it deeply, run safe setup/checks, and recommend adoption steps
---
Clone and deeply evaluate the repository at $1.

Use this repository location convention:

- GitHub repos: `~/code/github/<owner>/<repo>`
- If needed later for other hosts: `~/code/git/<host>/<owner>/<repo>`
- Temporary evaluations: `~/code/tmp/<owner>-<repo>`

Procedure:

1. Parse the repository host, owner, and repo name from `$1`.
2. If this is a GitHub repo, use the conventional destination `~/code/github/<owner>/<repo>`.
3. If the destination parent directory does not exist, create it.
4. If the repo is not already present locally, clone it there.
5. If it already exists locally, do not reclone. Instead:
   - report the existing path
   - inspect the current checkout
   - fetch remote state if useful for review, but do not change branches unless asked
6. Inspect the repo before running anything:
   - `README*`
   - `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
   - package/runtime files (`package.json`, `bun.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `uv.lock`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.)
   - top-level structure
   - docs and examples
   - recent git activity and current status
7. Determine the runtime and package manager from the repo files.
8. Ask for confirmation before any expensive, stateful, or external side effects. Safe local checks are allowed, but be conservative.
9. If appropriate and low-risk, perform a deeper evaluation:
   - install dependencies using the repo's native package manager
   - run the most relevant read-only checks (`test`, `check`, `lint`, `build`, or documented validation commands)
   - do not deploy, publish, or modify unrelated files
10. Summarize findings:
   - what the repo is
   - stack and architecture
   - maturity and maintenance status
   - setup quality and developer experience
   - whether it runs cleanly locally
   - how relevant it is to my pi workflow
   - risks, caveats, or signs of staleness
11. Recommend next actions:
   - give 3–5 ranked suggestions
   - clearly identify the single highest-leverage thing to do next
   - separate "adopt now" from "interesting later"

Constraints:

- Be conservative.
- Prefer read-only exploration first.
- Do not edit files, commit, open PRs, or install global tools unless I explicitly ask.
- Show the final local path clearly.
- If the repo contains pi-specific docs, skills, prompts, extensions, or packages, call those out explicitly.
